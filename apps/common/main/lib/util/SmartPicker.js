/*
 * Shared Smart Picker plumbing for the three editors.
 *
 * The "/" flow reproduces the one in Nextcloud's Text app, which drives it with
 * @tiptap/suggestion configured as {char: '/', allowedPrefixes: [' ']} (see
 * text/src/extensions/LinkPicker.js). Everything the user types stays in the
 * document; the menu is only a view of it:
 *
 *   - "/" at the start of a block or after a space opens the menu, and is
 *     written to the document like any other character.
 *   - Each further character is written AND narrows the list. Tiptap derives the
 *     query from the document with /[^\s\/]*\/, so a space or a second "/" ends
 *     the match: the menu closes and the character is written as normal.
 *   - Backspace shortens the query; backspacing over the "/" itself closes the
 *     menu.
 *   - Up/Down move the highlight, Enter and Tab accept, Escape dismisses. These
 *     four are the only keys taken away from the editor.
 *   - Accepting an entry replaces "/" plus the query with the picker's result,
 *     the way tiptap's command() does deleteRange(range) before inserting.
 *
 * Writer, Presentation and Spreadsheet share all of that, and share it through
 * install() rather than by copy. Only what genuinely differs per editor stays in
 * the controllers: how insertLink puts the reply into the document, and -- in
 * the spreadsheet, which has no text caret until a cell is being edited -- where
 * the menu is anchored.

         * Whether the trigger text is still sitting where it was typed.
         *
         * The deletion primitive cannot answer this. pluginMethod_InputText(text,
         * textReplace) does not match textReplace against the document at all -- it
         * fires textReplace.length backspaces at the caret and inserts. Verified
         * against a running editor: with "Hello world" and the caret at the end,
         * asking it to replace "ZZZZ" -- a string that appears nowhere -- left
         * "Hello w".
         *
         * So anything that moves the caret between picking a provider and the reply
         * arriving turns the deletion into silent damage, and co-editing makes that
         * reachable without the user doing anything: a remote change shifts this
         * user's caret, and onActivity does not fire because a remote change is not
         * a keystroke here. The trigger is also visible to everyone as literal text
         * while the picker is open, so a co-author may simply tidy it away.
         *
         * Failure is not symmetric. Leaving a stray "/query" behind is cosmetic and
         * the user can delete it; eating four characters of someone else's sentence
         * is data loss that syncs to everyone. So this only permits the deletion
         * when the text before the caret still looks like what was typed.
         *
         * What "the word before the caret" means is sdkjs's answer, not a guess,
         * and it is not the same for both shapes of trigger. Measured against a
         * running Writer with the caret at the end:
         *
         *     "Hello /pro"  -> "pro"      "/pro" -> "pro"
         *     "Hello /"     -> "/"        ""     -> ""
         *
         * So "/" is a boundary once a query follows it, but on its own the
         * punctuation run is itself the current word. Expecting "" for a bare
         * trigger -- which is what the boundary rule alone suggests -- made this
         * refuse every deletion for the commonest flow there is: type "/", pick
         * the first entry, and the "/" stayed in the document in front of the
         * link.
         *
         * Editors whose api does not expose asc_GetCurrentWord (Presentation and
         * Spreadsheet at the time of writing -- it is exported only in word/api.js)
